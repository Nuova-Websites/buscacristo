    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.jesusChrist.whoIs.p1">
        Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Savior and Redeemer of the world. He is the central figure of our faith and the foundation of our hope. Through His infinite Atonement, all mankind may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.
    </p>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.jesusChrist.whoIs.p2">
        We believe that Jesus Christ is the literal Son of God, born of Mary in Bethlehem. He lived a perfect, sinless life, showing us the way to live and serve others. His teachings, miracles, and example provide the pattern for our lives.

    <h2 data-i18n="doctrinePages.jesusChrist.atonement.title">The Atonement of Jesus Christ</h2>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.jesusChrist.atonement.p1">
        The Atonement of Jesus Christ is the central doctrine of our faith. Through His suffering in Gethsemane and His death on the cross, Jesus Christ took upon Himself the sins, pains, and afflictions of all mankind. This infinite sacrifice makes it possible for us to be forgiven of our sins and return to live with our Heavenly Father.
    </p>
    <div class="scripture-quote">
        <span data-i18n="doctrinePages.jesusChrist.atonement.scripture">"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."</span>

    </div>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.jesusChrist.atonement.p2">
        The Atonement not only provides forgiveness for our sins but also gives us strength to overcome our weaknesses and challenges. Through His grace, we can become better people and draw closer to God.
    </p>

        As followers of Jesus Christ, we strive to live as He lived. This means loving God with all our heart, might, mind, and strength, and loving our neighbors as ourselves. We seek to serve others, show compassion, and live with integrity and faith.
    </p>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.jesusChrist.following.p2">
        Christ taught us to be humble, forgiving, and charitable. He showed us how to pray, how to treat others with kindness, and how to trust in our Heavenly Father's plan. By following His example, we can find peace, joy, and purpose in our lives.

    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.jesusChrist.relationship.p1">
        Jesus Christ is not just a historical figure to us—He is our living Savior. We believe He knows each of us personally and loves us unconditionally. Through prayer, scripture study, and following His teachings, we can develop a personal relationship with Him.
    </p>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.jesusChrist.relationship.p2">
