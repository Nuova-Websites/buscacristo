    <h2 data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.whatIs.title">What is a Prophet?</h2>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.whatIs.p1">
        A prophet is a man called by God to be His spokesman on earth. Prophets receive revelation from God and teach His will to the people. They are chosen by God to lead His church and to guide His children in righteousness. Throughout history, God has called prophets to teach His gospel and to warn His people.
    </p>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.whatIs.p2">
        Prophets are not perfect men, but they are called of God and sustained by the people. They receive inspiration and revelation to guide the church and to help God's children navigate the challenges of their time. They speak for God and provide direction for our lives.
    </p>

<div class="doctrine-section">
    <h2 data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.modernRevelation.title">Modern-Day Revelation</h2>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.modernRevelation.p1">
        We believe that God continues to speak to His children today through living prophets. Just as God spoke to Moses, Isaiah, and other ancient prophets, He speaks to His prophets today. This modern revelation helps us understand God's will for our time and provides guidance for the challenges we face.
    </p>
    <div class="scripture-quote">
        <span data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.modernRevelation.scripture">"Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets."</span>

    </div>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.modernRevelation.p2">
        Modern revelation comes through the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who serves as the prophet, seer, and revelator for the entire world. This revelation is given in general conference addresses, official statements, and other inspired communications.
    </p>

<div class="doctrine-section">
    <h2 data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.firstPresidency.title">The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve</h2>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.firstPresidency.p1">
        The First Presidency consists of the President of the Church and his two counselors. The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles are special witnesses of Jesus Christ and serve under the direction of the First Presidency. Together, these fifteen men form the governing body of the church and receive revelation for the entire world.
    </p>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.firstPresidency.p2">
        These men are called of God and sustained by the members of the church. They travel throughout the world to teach, testify, and minister to God's children. They provide guidance on matters of doctrine, policy, and personal conduct. Their teachings help us understand God's will and live according to His commandments.

<div class="doctrine-section">
    <h2 data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.generalConference.title">General Conference</h2>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.generalConference.p1">
        Twice a year, the church holds general conference, where the prophet and other church leaders speak to the entire world. These conferences are broadcast worldwide and provide an opportunity for all members to hear the word of God through His chosen servants. The messages given in general conference are considered scripture and provide guidance for our lives.
    </p>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.generalConference.p2">
        General conference addresses cover a wide range of topics, including faith, repentance, service, family, and current challenges facing the world. These messages provide comfort, guidance, and direction for members of the church and anyone who chooses to listen. They help us understand how to apply gospel principles in our daily lives.

    <h2 data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.following.title">Following the Prophet</h2>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.following.p1">
        We are encouraged to follow the counsel of the living prophets. Their teachings help us stay on the path that leads to eternal life. When we follow their guidance, we are blessed with peace, protection, and spiritual growth. The prophet's words are not just suggestions but are inspired guidance from God.
    </p>
    <div class="scripture-quote">
        <span data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.following.scripture">"Whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same."</span>

    </div>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.following.p2">
        Following the prophet requires faith and obedience. We may not always understand why certain counsel is given, but we can trust that it comes from God and is for our benefit. As we follow the prophet's guidance, we will be blessed and protected from the evils of the world.
