                    <h2>What is the Plan of Salvation?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Plan of Salvation is God's eternal plan for the happiness and salvation of His children. It explains our purpose in life, where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going after death. This plan was established before the world was created and provides the framework for our eternal progression.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The plan includes three main phases: pre-mortal life, mortal life, and life after death. Each phase is essential for our eternal development and happiness. Through this plan, we can become like our Heavenly Father and live with Him forever in eternal families.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="doctrine-section">
                    <h2>Pre-Mortal Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        Before we were born on earth, we lived with our Heavenly Father as His spirit children. We were created in His image and had the potential to become like Him. In this pre-mortal existence, we learned about God's plan and chose to come to earth to gain physical bodies and experience mortality.
                    </p>
                    <div class="scripture-quote">
                        "Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto the nations."
                        <div class="scripture-reference">Jeremiah 1:5</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        In the pre-mortal life, we developed our personalities, talents, and spiritual gifts. We also made choices that influenced our earthly experiences. This pre-mortal existence helps explain why we have different circumstances and challenges in this life.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="doctrine-section">
                    <h2>Mortal Life</h2>
                    <p>
                        Mortal life is a time of testing and growth. We are here to gain physical bodies, learn to choose between good and evil, and develop faith in Jesus Christ. This life is not easy, but it is essential for our eternal progression. Through our experiences, we learn to become more like our Heavenly Father.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During mortality, we face challenges, make mistakes, and experience both joy and sorrow. These experiences help us develop character, compassion, and wisdom. We also have the opportunity to learn about the gospel, make covenants with God, and serve others. The choices we make in this life determine our eternal destiny.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="doctrine-section">
                    <h2>Life After Death</h2>
                    <p>
                        After death, our spirits go to the spirit world, where we continue to learn and grow. The spirit world is divided into paradise and prison, based on our acceptance of the gospel during mortality. Those who accepted the gospel go to paradise, while those who did not go to prison, where they can still learn about the gospel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Eventually, all people will be resurrected and judged according to their works and desires. Based on our choices and faithfulness, we will be assigned to one of three kingdoms of glory: the celestial kingdom (the highest), the terrestrial kingdom, or the telestial kingdom. The celestial kingdom is where we can live with God and our families forever.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="doctrine-section">
                    <h2>The Atonement of Jesus Christ</h2>
                    <p>
                        Central to the Plan of Salvation is the Atonement of Jesus Christ. Through His suffering, death, and resurrection, Jesus Christ made it possible for us to overcome sin and death. His Atonement provides the way for us to return to our Heavenly Father and receive eternal life.
                    </p>
                    <div class="scripture-quote">
                        "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
                        <div class="scripture-reference">John 3:16</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The Atonement is not just about forgiveness of sins, but also about enabling us to become better people. Through Christ's grace, we can overcome our weaknesses, develop Christlike attributes, and progress toward eternal life. The Atonement makes the Plan of Salvation possible.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="doctrine-section">
                    <h2>Our Role in the Plan</h2>
                    <p>
                        We have an important role to play in the Plan of Salvation. We must choose to follow Jesus Christ, keep His commandments, and serve others. We should strive to develop faith, repent of our sins, be baptized, receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, and endure to the end. These are the principles and ordinances of the gospel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We also have a responsibility to help others understand and accept the plan. This includes sharing the gospel with our friends and family, serving in the church, and being examples of righteousness. As we help others come unto Christ, we are participating in God's work and helping to fulfill His plan.
                    </p>
                </div>
