                    <h2>What is the Priesthood?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The priesthood is the power and authority of God given to man to act in His name for the salvation of His children. It is the power by which the earth was created, the gospel is preached, and the ordinances of salvation are performed. The priesthood is not just a title or position, but a sacred trust and responsibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The priesthood is divided into two parts: the Aaronic Priesthood and the Melchizedek Priesthood. The Aaronic Priesthood is the lesser priesthood, which includes the offices of deacon, teacher, priest, and bishop. The Melchizedek Priesthood is the higher priesthood, which includes the offices of elder, high priest, patriarch, seventy, and apostle.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="doctrine-section">
                    <h2>The Restoration of the Priesthood</h2>
                    <p>
                        After the death of the apostles, the priesthood authority was lost from the earth. This is known as the Great Apostasy. In 1829, the priesthood was restored to the earth through Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery. John the Baptist appeared to them and conferred the Aaronic Priesthood. Later, Peter, James, and John appeared and conferred the Melchizedek Priesthood.
                    </p>
                    <div class="scripture-quote">
                        "And this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God."
                        <div class="scripture-reference">Doctrine and Covenants 84:19</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The restoration of the priesthood was essential for the restoration of the true church of Jesus Christ. Without priesthood authority, the ordinances of salvation could not be performed with power and effect. The priesthood is the foundation of the church and the means by which God's work is accomplished on earth.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="doctrine-section">
                    <h2>Priesthood Offices and Responsibilities</h2>
                    <p>
                        Each priesthood office has specific responsibilities and duties. Deacons pass the sacrament, teachers help with home teaching and other assignments, priests can baptize and administer the sacrament, and bishops preside over wards. Elders can give blessings, perform baptisms, and serve missions. High priests often serve in leadership positions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The priesthood is not about power or position, but about service and responsibility. Those who hold the priesthood are called to serve others and to help them come unto Christ. They are to be examples of righteousness and to use their authority to bless and strengthen others.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="doctrine-section">
                    <h2>Priesthood Blessings and Ordinances</h2>
                    <p>
                        Through the priesthood, many blessings and ordinances are performed. These include baptisms, confirmations, sacrament administration, temple ordinances, and blessings for the sick. Priesthood blessings can provide comfort, guidance, and healing. They are performed by the power of God and can bring great spiritual and physical benefits.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Priesthood ordinances are essential for salvation. Baptism, confirmation, and temple ordinances must be performed by proper priesthood authority to be valid. These ordinances are not just symbolic but have real power and effect. They are the means by which we receive the blessings of the gospel and progress toward eternal life.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="doctrine-section">
                    <h2>Honoring the Priesthood</h2>
                    <p>
                        Those who hold the priesthood are expected to live worthy lives and to honor their calling. This includes being honest, kind, and faithful. They should study the scriptures, pray regularly, and strive to follow the example of Jesus Christ. The priesthood is a sacred trust that should not be taken lightly.
                    </p>
                    <div class="scripture-quote">
                        "The rights of the priesthood are inseparably connected with the powers of heaven, and that the powers of heaven cannot be controlled nor handled only upon the principles of righteousness."
                        <div class="scripture-reference">Doctrine and Covenants 121:36</div>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        When priesthood holders live righteously, they can access the powers of heaven and perform miracles. When they are unrighteous, the priesthood power is withdrawn. The priesthood is not about personal glory or power, but about serving God and His children with humility and love.
                    </p>
                </div>
