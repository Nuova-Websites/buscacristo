    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.bookOfMormon.whatIs.p1">
        The Book of Mormon is another testament of Jesus Christ, confirming the truths found in the Bible. It is a sacred record of ancient American civilizations and contains the fullness of the everlasting gospel. The book was written by ancient prophets who lived on the American continent from approximately 600 B.C. to A.D. 421.
    </p>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.bookOfMormon.whatIs.p2">
        The Book of Mormon testifies of Jesus Christ and His divine mission. It teaches the same principles of faith, repentance, baptism, and the gift of the Holy Ghost that are found in the Bible. Together, the Bible and the Book of Mormon provide a more complete understanding of God's plan for His children.

        The Book of Mormon was translated by Joseph Smith through the gift and power of God. The original records were written on gold plates and were buried in the earth for over 1,400 years. In 1823, the angel Moroni appeared to Joseph Smith and told him about these sacred records.
