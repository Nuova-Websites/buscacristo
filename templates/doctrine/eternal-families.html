    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.divineNature.p1">
        Families are central to God's plan for His children. We believe that families can be together forever through sacred temple ordinances. The family is the fundamental unit of society and the most important organization in time and eternity. God established families to provide love, support, and guidance for His children.
    </p>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.divineNature.p2">
        The family is where we learn to love, serve, and care for others. It is where we develop our character, values, and faith. Through family relationships, we experience joy, growth, and the blessings of God's love. The family provides a safe haven where we can learn, grow, and become the people God wants us to be.

    <h2 data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.templeMarriage.title">Temple Marriage and Eternal Families</h2>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.templeMarriage.p1">
        In temples, worthy couples can be sealed together for time and all eternity. This sacred ordinance, performed by proper priesthood authority, binds families together beyond death. When a couple is sealed in the temple, their marriage is not just for this life but for eternity.
    </p>
    <div class="scripture-quote">
        <span data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.templeMarriage.scripture">"And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."</span>
        <div class="scripture-reference" data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.templeMarriage.reference">Matthew 16:19</div>
    </div>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.templeMarriage.p2">
        Children born to parents who have been sealed in the temple are automatically sealed to their parents for eternity. This means that families can be together forever, not just until death separates them. This is one of the greatest blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

    <h2 data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.familyHistory.title">Family History and Temple Work</h2>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.familyHistory.p1">
        We believe that all of God's children, both living and dead, should have the opportunity to receive the blessings of the gospel. Through family history research and temple work, we can help our deceased ancestors receive the ordinances of salvation, including baptism, confirmation, and temple sealing.
    </p>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.familyHistory.p2">
        Family history work connects us to our ancestors and helps us understand our heritage. It strengthens our families and brings us closer to God. When we perform temple ordinances for our ancestors, we are helping them progress in their eternal journey and strengthening the bonds of our eternal family.

    <h2 data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.strengthening.title">Strengthening Families Today</h2>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.strengthening.p1">
        While eternal families are a future blessing, we can begin strengthening our families today. This includes regular family prayer, scripture study, and family home evening. We should also spend quality time together, support each other, and work together to overcome challenges.
    </p>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.strengthening.p2">
        Strong families are built on principles of love, respect, forgiveness, and service. Parents should teach their children the gospel and help them develop faith in Jesus Christ. Children should honor and obey their parents. When families work together and support each other, they become stronger and more united.

    <h2 data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.promise.title">The Promise of Eternal Families</h2>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.promise.p1">
        The promise of eternal families gives us hope and comfort in times of loss and separation. We know that death is not the end of our relationships with our loved ones. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ and the power of the priesthood, families can be reunited and live together forever in the presence of God.
    </p>
    <div class="scripture-quote">
        <span data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.promise.scripture">"And if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!"</span>
        <div class="scripture-reference" data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.promise.reference">Doctrine and Covenants 18:15</div>
    </div>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.eternalFamilies.promise.p2">
        This promise motivates us to live righteously and to work towards being worthy of eternal life. It encourages us to strengthen our family relationships and to help others come unto Christ. The family is not just a temporary arrangement but an eternal institution that will continue forever.
