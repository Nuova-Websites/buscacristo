    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.whatIs.p1">
        A prophet is a man called by God to be His spokesman on earth. Prophets receive revelation from God and teach His will to the people. They are chosen by God to lead His church and to guide His children in righteousness. Throughout history, God has called prophets to teach His gospel and to warn His people.
    </p>
    <p data-i18n="doctrinePages.livingProphets.whatIs.p2">
        Prophets are not perfect men, but they are called of God and sustained by the people. They receive inspiration and revelation to guide the church and to help God's children navigate the challenges of their time. They speak for God and provide direction for our lives.
